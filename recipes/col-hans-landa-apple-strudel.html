<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>375g ready-rolled puff pastry
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 tbsp raspberry conserve</li>
        <li>4 tbsp ground almonds</li>
        <li>4 medium bramley apples</li>
        <li>170g raisins or sultanas</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>Icing sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Method</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Cut the sheet of pastry in half widthways. On a lightly floured surface, roll one half out into a 30cm x 40cm rectangle – the pastry will get very thin.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the pastry with half the oil, leaving a 2.5cm border. Using a palette knife, spread 4 tbsp of the conserve within the border and sprinkle 2 tbsp of the ground almonds over the top.</li>
        <li>Peel and grate the apples into a colander, then squeeze out as much juice as you can. Spread half over the pastry, making sure the apple is evenly spread, followed by half the raisins or sultanas and a sprinkling of cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Carefully roll from the long edge of the pastry to form a log. Turn so the seal is underneath, then tuck the ends under and brush all over with milk. Transfer to a lined baking sheet, then repeat with the remaining pastry and ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes until golden and puffed up. Leave to cool on a wire rack. When cold, sprinkle with some icing sugar, then cut into slices. Eat and enjoy.</li>    
    </ol>
